- e2e testing
- comment the code!
- implement a new page that has multiple subpages (1, 2, 3, etc)
- check if site works in IE <= 8
- use main menu service to store all info required to dynamically generate routes
- make page transitions smoother
- work out how to get Angular to process expressions within HTML comments
- sort out display of bullet points between links (slightly offset)
- i18n
