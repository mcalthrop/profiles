## This branch
This branch uses AngularJS to implement the required functionality in a single-page app.

## To do:
- make further use of directives: header and footer
- put logic in main-menu so that it auto-generates and sets CSS class according to which item is currently selected
- add alt text to images
- work out how to get Angular to process expressions within HTML comments
- sort out display of bullet points between links (slightly offset)
- separate out controllers to individual files
- unit testing
- i18n
