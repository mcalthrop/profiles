## This branch
This branch uses AngularJS to implement the required functionality in a single-page app.

## Pipeline
- set up grunt build environment
- travis integration
- complete unit tests for controllers, directives (?), models (TDD) and services
- comment the code!
- implement a new page that has multiple subpages (1, 2, 3, etc)
- check if site works in IE <= 8
- use main menu service to store all info required to dynamically generate routes
- put logic in main-menu so that it sets CSS class according to which item is currently selected
- make page transitions smoother
- work out how to get Angular to process expressions within HTML comments
- sort out display of bullet points between links (slightly offset)
- i18n
